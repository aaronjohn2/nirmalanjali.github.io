Nirmalanjali is a school dedicated exclusively to the teaching of Bharatanatyam, the most popular and widely practiced classical dance of Tamil Nadu, India, more than 2000 years old, rooted in Natya Sastra, the earliest treatise on dance and drama written by the sage and priest Bharata. At Nirmalanjali, we pride ourselves in training students of all ages to turn their passion into something greater, not just a professional dancer but their holistic development. This devotional art not only passes on our cultural values to students but also helps them with discipline and their social well-being.
